**Title**: Nano-patterning of surfaces by ion sputtering:
Numerical study of the anisotropic damped Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.

&nbsp;

**Abstract**: A numerical approach is presented for a model describing
the pattern formation by ion beam sputtering on a material surface. This
process is responsible for the appearance of un- expectedly organized
patterns, such as ripples, nanodots, and hexagonal arrays of nanoholes.
A numerical analysis of preexisting patterns is proposed to investigate
surface dynamics, based on a model resumed in an anisotropic damped
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, in a two dimensional surface with
periodic boundary conditions. While deterministic, its highly nonlinear
character gives a rich range of results, making it possible to describe
accurately different patterns. A finite-difference semi-implicit time
splitting scheme is employed on the discretization of the governing
equation. Simulations were conducted with realistic coeffi- cients
related to physical parameters (anisotropies, beam orientation,
diffusion). The stability of the numerical scheme is analyzed with time
step and grid spacing tests for the pattern evolution, and the Method of
Manufactured Solutions has been used to verify the scheme. Ripples and
hexagonal patterns were obtained from a monomodal initial condition for
certain values of the damping coefficient, while spatiotemporal chaos
appeared for lower values. The anisotropy effects on pattern formation
were studied, varying the angle of incidence.
