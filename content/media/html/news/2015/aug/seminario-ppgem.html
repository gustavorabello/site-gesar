## NUMERICAL MODELLING OF TWO-PHASE FLOWS WITH MOVING CONTACT LINES

&nbsp;

**Autor**: **Erik Gros** - Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL)

&nbsp;

**Resumo**:
Numerical simulation is employed to simulate two-phase flow phenomena
using the continuum method for surface tension modeling. The set of
equations are based on the "one-fluid" Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
(ALE) description of the Navier-Stokes equations. These equations are
discretized by the Finite Element method on an unstructured mesh in
which the phase boundary is represented by a set of interconnected
elements that are part of the computational mesh, thus a sharp
representation is successfully achieved. The presented modeling will
then be used to investigate two-phase flows with moving contact lines,
slug and annular flows in microchannels. These problems are of great
interest for technology applications such as the cooling of
microelectronic devices. The employed formulation, the interface
representation, bubble-wall modeling and some initial results of this
Ph.D. thesis will be presented for 2-dimensional cartesian and
axisymmetric cylindrical coordinates.

**CV resumido do autor**:
After finishing high-school in Brussels (Belgium), Erik Gros went to
study Mechanical Engineering at the RWTH Aachen (Germany) university. He
obtained his Bachelor degree in February 2013 and his Master degree in
October 2014. During his studies he had a strong link with Numerical
Simulation and Fluid Dynamics. In the Bachelor project, Gros compared
the simulation results of a viscoelastic Poiseuille flow to its
analytical solution. In the Master thesis he implemented a moving grid
method in a finite volume flow solver. He is currently a Ph.D. student
at the Heat and Mass Transfer Laboratory (LTCM) of the Swiss Federal
Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) under supervision of Prof.
John. R. Thome and Prof. Gustavo Anjos from the State University of Rio
de Janeiro (UERJ). His field of research is numerical simulation of
two-phase flows in microchannels where surface tension effects are
dominant.

## THERMOCAPILLARY MIGRATION OF BUBBLES IN MICROCHANNELS USING SELF-REWETTING LIQUIDS

&nbsp;

**Autor**: **Robson Nazereth** - University of Edinburgh


&nbsp;

**Resumo**:
A 2D two-phase DNS model has been developed in Ansys CFX. The governing
equations are solved numerically via the _nite-volume method. The volume
fraction and interface were modelled employing the volume-of-uid (VOF)
method with a compressive differencing scheme and the surface tension
force is modelled using the Continuum Surface Force (CSF) formulation.
The model is used to investigate thermocapillary migration of bubbles in
microchannels subject to temperature gradients using self-rewetting
fuids. Self-rewetting liquids present a non-linear (parabolic)
temperature dependence of surface tension that create a distinct bubble
behaviour compared with pure liquids like water that has a linear
dependence. Bubble dynamics using self-rewetting liquids in
microchannels is the focus of this work and some preliminary results
will be presented.

**CV resumido do autor**:
Robson Nazareth graduated in Physics at Universidade Federal do Rio
Grande do Sul in 2011. In 2013 he obtained a master in Physics at
Theoretical and Computational Models Group at the same university with a
CNPq fellowship. Since 2014 he is a PhD student with a Science without
Borders fellowship at Complex Fluids and Multiphase Flows Group at The
University of Edinburgh as part of the ThermaPower consortium. Currently
he is working with modelling of bubble ow in microchannels.
