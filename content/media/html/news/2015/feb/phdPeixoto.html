# D.Sc. Gustavo Charles Peixoto Oliveira, a new Ph.D. in multiphase flows 

&nbsp;

In the 20th February of 2015, the phd student Gustavo Charles Peixoto
Oliveira succedly presented his phd thesis to the examining committee
consisted by Profs. Norberto Mangiavacchi (director), Carlos Moura,
Jos&eacute; Henrique Carneiro de Ara&uacute;jo and Leonardo Santos de
Brito Alves, being approved unanimously. On behalf of the GESAR
laboratory, congratulations for the excelent work Ph.D Gustavo C.P.
Oliveira!

**Title**: Drop Jet in Crossflow: ALE/Finite Element Simulations and Interfacial Effects 

&nbsp;

**Abstract**: A two-phase flow computational code taking a hybrid
Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian description of movement along with the
Finite Element Method is used to simulate the dynamics of an
incompressible drop jet in crossflow in the primary breakup zone.
Dispersed entities are described by means of a front-tracking method
which produces zero-thickness interfaces through contiguous element
meshing and adaptive refinement techniques. Periodic boundary conditions
are implemented in a variationally consistent way for all the scalar
fields involved in the presented simulations and a modified version of
the pressure field is added to the “one-fluid” formulation employed in
the momentum equation. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations
for different flow configurations of immiscible liquids pertinent to
experimental results found in literature. Analyses of the hydrodynamics
of the drop jet in crossflow in these configurations considering
trajectories, drop shape variations, spectrum of small disturbances,
besides additional aspects relating to mesh quality are presented and
discussed.
