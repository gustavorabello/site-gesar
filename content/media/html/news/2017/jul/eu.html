# Professores do GESAR contemplados com projeto parceria com Universidades da Uni&atilde;o Europ&eacute;ia 

&nbsp;

Os professores do GESAR receberam o aceite do projeto de pesquisa
ThermaSMART, continua&ccedil;&atilde;o do projeto ThermaPOWER de
2015-2016, em colabora&ccedil;&atilde;o estreita entre pesquisadores de
diversos pa&iacute;ses europeus, EUA, Jap&atilde;o, China e
&Aacute;frica do Sul. Este projeto pretende estudar o fen&ocirc;meno de
mudan&ccedil;a de fase em processos de dissipa&ccedil;&atilde;o de
calor. Veja o abstract do projeto em ingl&ecirc;s abaixo.

Developments in modern high-speed microprocessors enhance communication,
computing and electronics, thereby playing a profound role in our
societies and industries. Sustaining long-term high speeds and reliable
operation requires efficient heat dissipation. Phase-change based
cooling offers a promising alternative to conventional air-cooling in
both earth and space environments. We will build on our previous FP7
IRSES THERMAPOWER project which led to major advancements in the
fundamental understanding of phase change phenomena. As a result of this
early work one researcher won an international prize and secured a
fellowship at MIT following the discovery of azimuthal currents in
evaporating drops. We aim to achieve this through the expansion of our
network, building new collaborations of top researchers from 15
world-class universities from EU, Asia, Africa, North America and South
America, and 3 European SMEs with expertise in precision experiments,
micro- fabrication, theoretical modelling, numerical simulation and
engineering design. This collaboration will enable knowledge transfer
and access to unique facilities at NASA, Intel, Brazilian Furnas,
Hitachi, IBM, Indian TIFR, Toronto SIE Lab, Tianjin Key Lab and Pretoria
Thermofluid Lab, training 43 early stage researchers in latest
experimental and modelling techniques. The research programme planned
addresses key questions in complexities of scale hitherto unstudied,
including contact line interactions amongst evaporating bubbles or
droplet populations on patterned substrates. The expertise will be
transferred through the planned secondments and exposure of all
secondees to different research environments. Besides regular meetings
and technical workshops, we will hold training schools at Maryland,
Kyushu, Toronto, Warsaw and Edinburgh. This will consolidate the EU's
position at the forefront of cutting-edge research in this area and will
promote a long lasting collaboration between Academia and Industry.
