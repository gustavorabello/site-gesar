&nbsp;

In the 13th December of 2016, the phd student Leon Ribeiro de Matos
succedly presented her phd thesis to the examining committee consisted
by Profs. Norberto Mangiavacchi (orientador), Daniel Chalhub,
Jos&eacute; da Rocha Miranda Pontes, Marcelo Savi (COPPE) e Su Jian
(COPPE), being approved unanimously. On behalf of the GESAR laboratory,
congratulations for the excelent work Ph.D Leon Ribeiro de Matos!

**Title**: Dynamic Behavior of Single-Phase Natural Convection
Loop Integrated to a Pool

&nbsp;

**Abstract**: Passive cooling systems find application on many areas of
engineering. Nuclear power industry is incorporating such system in new
power plant designs, with objective to achieve higher safety levels of
operation. Natural convection loops are passive cooling systems
consisting of two heat exchangers -- a heater and a cooler -- a
connecting circuit, where heat is absorbed in the heater and rejected in
the cooler. In most of designs, the circuit is connected to a pool which
transfers heat from/to it. Natural convection loops are the research
topic of many scientific works. The connection to the pool, however, is
not taken into account. The present work presents a computational study
of the dynamic behavior of single-phase natural convection loops
integrated to a pool, with focus on the thermo-hydraulic stability.
Linear and non-linear analyses are performed in order to characterize
the system dynamics. Results indicate a relevant contribution of the
pool, significantly enlarging stability regions.
