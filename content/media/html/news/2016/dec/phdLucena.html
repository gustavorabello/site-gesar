**Title**: Numerical study of CO2 dissolution in saline aquifers
with deformed interface

&nbsp;

**Abstract**: We address the problem of buoyancy-driven fingering
generated in porous media by the instability of a partially miscible
fluid layer dissolving in a less dense fluid existing underneath. The
fingering process induces an uneven distribution of dissolved CO2 in the
upper layers, which affects the surface tension ditribution at the
interface, and unstabilizes the geometry of the flat surface. We assume
a curved interface to model surface tension effects. The main purpose is
to check if the curved surface increases the CO2 dissolution rate and a
evaluate a curvature that maximizes the gas dissolution. A 2D time
dependent numerical simulation is performed, assuming that the flow is
governed by Darcyâ€™s law, along with the Boussinesq approximation, to
account for buoyancy effects introduced by concentration dependent
densities. The velocity field is modeled by a vorticity-stream function
formulation. The resulting equations are solved through the
Taylor-Galerkin Finite Element Method, using a Crank-Nicolson time
discretization.
