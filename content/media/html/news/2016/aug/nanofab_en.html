# The official webpage of the Nanofabrication Laboratory -- **NANOFAB** has been released

&nbsp;

On the 30th. August 2016 the official webpage of the Nanofabrication
Laboratory -- **NANOFAB** -- has been released. See below for a short
description of such an important laboratory of the Fonseca Teles complex
-- **PPG-EM/UERJ** --.  

&nbsp;

The Multi-User Laboratory Nanofabrication and Characterization of
Nanomaterials, **NANOFAB**, was established in the Department of Mechanical
Engineering at UERJ and is linked to the Graduate Program in Mechanical
Engineering (PPG-EM / UERJ) through the approved proposal for the
acquisition of a microscope electronic high-resolution SEM-FEG type the
Edict Pro Equipment CAPES 2013. This project started from a scientific
and technological demand in the field of electron microscopy and
nanotechnology, from the existence of research groups in nanomaterials
and nanodevices, organized in cooperation networks. In this context,
studies **NANOFAB** materials whose dimensions are below the micrometer
range. In addition, **NANOFAB** meet demands in the nanofabrication area
with the acquisition of a microscope FIB (Focused Ion Beam), from funds
approved in FAPERJ Notice 2015 Large Equipment.

&nbsp;

The **NANOFAB** can characterize nanostructured materials in the form of
powders, thin films and aggregates deposited on substrates and uses a
system of analysis for materials not conductive. The system allows
simultaneous analysis of topography and chemical composition of the
material. The FIB microscope also allow the preparation of samples for
transmission electron microscopy

&nbsp;

The **NANOFAB** supports strategic projects in several areas of the state
and the country, such as materials for industries in the oil and gas,
metal-mechanical, in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, in
the hydrogen generation, steel coatings and composites.

&nbsp;

# Coordination and Management Committee

&nbsp;

The **NANOFAB** is coordinated by prof. Norberto Mangiavacchi (UERJ) and is
vice-coordinator prof. Eduardo Albuquerque Brocchi (PUC-Rio). The
Committee Manager **NANOFAB**, is composed of three members elected every
two years. For the biennium 2016-2018, the Comite Manager **NANOFAB** is
formed by prof. Joseph Brant Campos (UERJ), Hector Reynaldo Meneses
Costa (CEFE) and Rog√©rio Navarro Smith Belt (PUC-Rio).

&nbsp;

# Units and Involved Programs / Research Projects

&nbsp;

Some units are directly linked to **NANOFAB**: The Faculty of UERJ
Engineering (Civil Engineering courses, Electrical Engineering and
Mechanical Engineering), the Chemical Institute of UERJ (Chemistry UERJ)
and the Institute of Physics at UERJ.
