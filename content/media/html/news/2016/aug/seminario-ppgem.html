## THE ROLE OF MATHEMATICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL MODELLING IN STENT DEVELOPMENT

&nbsp;

**Autor**: Dr. Sean McGinty - Dvision of Biomedical Engineering - University
of Glasgow, Scotland


&nbsp;

**Resumo**: Stents are tiny scaffolds which are used to widen arteries
where the blood flow has become restricted. The most common use of
stents is in treating coronary heart disease. These stents are now
typically coated with a drug to reduce inflammation and are therefore
called drug-eluting stents (DES). Over the past decade, various
generations have emerged which include biodegradable polymer coated,
polymer-free and bioresorbable stents. Whilst current DES generally
perform well, researchers across academia and industry are engaged in
trying to design better stents which can address important concerns such
as delayed healing and can be used in patients with more complicated
disease.

&nbsp;

Traditionally, a purely empirical approach has been adopted by
manufacturers in designing new stents. This is an extremely costly
process and there have been instances where stents have been shelved at
a late stage of development due to poor results. There is a growing
recognition within the community that a truly multi-disciplinary
approach is required to design the next generation stents, with
mathematical and computational modelling playing a key role. Indeed,
ideas from several branches of mathematics are required to successfully
tackle this problem. Currently, a number of approaches are being
adopted, including methods from continuum mechanics and mathematical
biology, inverse problem theory, structural and soft tissue mechanics,
numerical analysis and multi-objective optimisation. In modelling drug
transport, which is the focus of this talk, analytical/semi-analytical
and asymptotic approaches to solving coupled systems of
advection-diffusion-reaction equations have been considered, moving
boundary problems have been defined, and finite difference/finite
element methods have been devised to cope with increasing complexity.

&nbsp;

The purpose of this talk is three-fold. Firstly, it aims to provide a
flavour of the purpose and evolution of stents and the modelling
approaches that have been adopted thus far [1]. Secondly, a case study
will be presented from our own group, which demonstrates how
mathematical modelling has influenced the design of a novel drug-eluting
stent [2]. Thirdly, the remaining challenges in the field will be
discussed, which if overcome will allow for the design of optimized next
generation DES.
