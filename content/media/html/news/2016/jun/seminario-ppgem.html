## NONLINEAR DYNAMICS, CHAOS AND CONTROL OF SMART BIOINSPIRED

&nbsp;

**Autor**: Marcelo A. Savi - COPPE/UFRJ -- Centro de Mec&acirc;nica N&atilde;o-linear

&nbsp;

**Abstract**: Inspired by nature, researchers are trying to create
systems and structures that present adaptive behavior according to its
environment. The use of nature as an inspiration has the objective to
extract design principles from biological systems. Among many options of
smart sensors and actuators, shape memory alloys (SMAs), piezoelectric
and magnetostrictive materials are some interesting options. Due to
their remarkable properties, smart materials have been used in many
areas of human knowledge. This seminar presents some smart material
system applications and their thermomechanical behaviors. It is
discussed constitutive models that explore phenomenological features of
the thermomechanical response of smart materials. This constitutive
model is employed in order to describe some interesting behaviors and
potential applications of smart devices involving dynamical behavior.
Adaptive structures and origami systems are discussed. In this regard,
it should be highlighted their rich response including chaos and
attractor multistability. Chaos control is also employed showing
situations where tiny perturbations can avoid undesirable behaviors.

## RADIOTRACER TECHNIQUES FOR INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEASURES

&nbsp;

**Autor**: Vitor Ramos - PPG-EM/UERJ

&nbsp;

**Abstract**: Radiotracers techniques highlights are to be an absolute
and non-destructive measurement. The main application is calculations of
flows in pipelines or rivers, and identify problems in industrial
mixers. The disadvantages are the specific instruments measures and
radioactive aliquot, which require a reactor to proper activation or
buying of the radiotracer.
