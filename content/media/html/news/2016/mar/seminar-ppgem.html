## NUMERICAL SEQUENCES IN SCIENTIFIC COMPUTING: Half Functional Analysis, half Philosophy look

&nbsp;
**Author**: Carlos A. de Moura - IME/UERJ - http://lattes.cnpq.br/7810980300080088

&nbsp;
**Abstract**: The mathematicians real line is a deep theoretical
concept. Its use in computer simulation is backed by the floating point
"real" line theory, which has been incorporated to Numerical Analysis
since its early days, by Wilkinson and von Neumann. Nevertheless, there
exist still some blurred questions about computer simulation of real
sequences convergence. These may either puzzle mathematical philosophy
dwellers, like R. Hersh, or lead to some worries related to the very
convergence proving. The latter ones are backed by Functional Analysis
techniques, and may carry out the "false convergence" danger, as will be
discussed.
