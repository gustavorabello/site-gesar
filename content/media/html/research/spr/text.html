<b>OBJECTIVE</b>
<br>
Experimental and Computational study of single-phase Natural Circulation
Loops

<br><br>
<b>CONTEXT</b>
<br>

A large number of papers published in the last ten years with numerical
and experimental results from natural circulation loops shows the
importance of this topic. With respect to applications in nuclear
industry, the circuit which cools the nuclear reactors in Brazilian
power plants -- Angra 1, 2 and 3 -- may operate by natural
convection in case of unavailability of the reactor coolant pumps, and
the dynamic behavior of such flow must be well understood at the design
phase. Another application is the facility for spent fuel storage, under
design by Eletronuclear, which will count with a fully passive heat
removal system.

<b>RESEARCH FOCUS</b>
<br>
<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
<LI>similarity parameters
<LI>influence of system's parameters -- diameter, heat load, cooler heat
transfer coefficient etc. -- on thermo-hydraulic stability.
<LI> effect of water mass intermediating the loop's heater and the
primary heat load, e.g., integration between circuit and pool, on the
system's dynamic behavior
<LI>computational modeling: friction correlation and numerical formulation.
<LI>3D simulation
<LI>stability analysis
</UL>

<b>MOTIVATION</b>
<br>
At the same time that applications of single-phase Passive Cooling
Systems grow, notably in safety systems in nuclear installations, there
isn't so far a well accepted friction correlation for natural
convection flows. In deed, correlations for forced convection are
normally used in natural convection circuits.
Additionally, there isn't available results taking integration between
loop and pool into account.

<br>
<br>
<b>FINAL PRODUCT</b>
<br>
<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
<LI>establishment of a criterion for selection of most appropriate friction factor for natural circulation loops or a proposition of a new correlation.
<LI>computational code (computer program, free for download) for sizing and transient simulation of Passive Cooling Systems.
<LI>to provide experimental data for single-phase Passive Cooling Systems.
</UL>

<b>PARTIAL RESULTS</b>
<br><br>
A 1D model has been implemented in Matlab&reg; to simulate a
natural circulation loop with heater and cooler as piping sections. The
model consists of conservation equations for momentum and energy, both
for mean quantities in the tube cross section. Momentum equation is also
integrated along the loop's length. The following processes are
neglected in the model:<br>

<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
<LI>heat conduction
<LI>heat generation by friction
<LI>heat transfer across pipe walls (except in heater and cooler).
</UL>

The governing equations are:

<b>EXPERIMENT</b>
<br><br>

The experimental setup consists on a rectangular loop, 1 m tall and 0.8
m wide, with horizontal heater and cooler. The thermal load is supplied
to the system by means of three electrical resistances 667 W each,
building up a total power capacity of 2000 W. The cooler is a tube in
tube heat exchanger, where the work fluid of the loop flows through the
inner tube and a cooling fluid flows (forced) through the outer tube
(<i>annulus</i>). The system is equipped with 4 digital temperature
sensors, positioned at the inlet and outlet of heater and cooler.
Insturmentation is performed via a Arduino MEGA 2560 board. The
following figure shows the dimensional drawing and a picture of the
loop.

The construction of the loop had a little delay because one of our team
members got a bit late to work one day...<br> The team member was <a
href="http://www.gesar.uerj.br/people/grad/tinoco.html">Jo&atilde;o
Pedro</a> and the cause: his grandmother's <i>macarronada</i> recipe.
That's right. The recipe is so good that our friend overfed himself,
resulting in digestive disturbs...<br> Well, for those who are moderate,
we will post the recipe here soon!!
