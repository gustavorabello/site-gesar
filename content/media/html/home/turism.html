# Rio de Janeiro

&nbsp;

Rio de Janeiro is a dynamic  and modern city, with several entertainment
spots spread around  city center, north, south, and west zone,
specifically in Barra da Tijuca. The city offers fun every day of the
week, from choro and samba shows (musical culture of Rio de Janeiro) to
museums, playhouse and international recognition sights.

&nbsp;

The city of Niteroi is located across the Guanabara Bay, 11km from the
city center of Rio de Janeiro, and is also an excellent choice for
tourism, especially for its cultural and historical centers and its
wonderful beaches. Few hotels are available in the area, however the
transport of Rio de Janeiro to Niter&oacute;i has a boats network that crosses
the bay and also intercity buses that can be accessed at the terminal
Menezes Cortes and at several points of the wonderful city. The terminal
of the boats is located on the Pra&ccedil;a XY region, in the city center. A
VLT line is under construction and will connect the bus terminal in
Brazil’s central to the Pra&ccedil;a XY, but the work is predicted to be ended
in the end of 2016.

&nbsp;

The metro network Rio has 3 subway lines, connecting Tijuca to Ipanema
(line 1 - red), Pavuna to Botafogo (line 2 - green) and the latest
extension connecting Ipanema to Barra da Tijuca through the line 4
(yellow). In addition to the subway, the Rio de Janeiro has eight
metropolitan train extensions connecting the center of Rio de Janeiro to
the west (Deodoro, Santa Cruz and Campo Grande) and other places as
Paracambi, Belford Roxo, Guapimirim and Japeri. The trains mesh runs by
the Supervia administration. The VLT initially has a line that connects
Novo Rio Road to Santos Dumond Airport, through the Olympic Boulevard,
Av. Rio Branco and Cinelandia. Is scheduled for 2017, the inauguration
of two lines of the VLT: one connecting Brazil's central to Pra&ccedil;a XV and
another linking Brazil's central to Santos Dumond Airport.

&nbsp;

The bus service from the city of Rio de Janeiro has a newly installed
BRT network  (Bus For Rapid Transport) which has a large articulated bus
fleet and over 90km in exclusive lanes throughout the city. The BRT is a
great option for those who want to leave the Tom Jobim International

# The Imperial district of S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o

&nbsp;

With a privileged location, the district is close to the center of the
city, has transport infrastructure (train, subway and bus) and has the
largest fun urban area of the city: Quinta da Boa Vista.  From
S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o, is easy to get quickly to the South
Zone, Niter&oacute;i and districts of the North Zone, such as Tijuca,
Andara&iacute; and Vila Isabel, the latter known for the exuberance of
its routes and the hustle promoted by traditional restaurants and bars.
In the imperial district, we also have the Red Line, which facilitates
access to the Tom Jobim International Airport, the Via Dutra and the
Baixada Fluminense.

&nbsp;

Quinta da Boa Vista is a municipal park located in the district of S&atilde;o
Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o, where there is the National Museum of Anthropology and
Archaeology and the zoo of Rio de Janeiro. The attractions are an
excellent choice for those who visit Rio de Janeiro and want to escape
(at least for one afternoon) of the trendiest scripts.
 
&nbsp;

On the way to the S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o Palace, the visitor
is struck by the beauty of the gardens and lakes. The building was used
as the official residence of the Portuguese royal family, when the Court
left Europe, fleeing from Napoleon Bonaparte's troops. Then remained the
residence of the Brazilian imperial family, after the Proclamation of
Independence. It was there that Dom Pedro II was born and grew up.
Currently, the palace has the [National Museum][museuufrj],
administrated by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. On the
neighborhood, visitors can also find the [Military Museum Conde de
Linhares][condedelinhares] and the [Museum of Astronomy and Related
