# Short History of GESAR

&nbsp;

The GESAR group (Group for Studies and Environmental Simulations
in Water Reservoirs) was founded in 2005 after a R&#38;D project
managed by the brazilian power utility company <a
    href="www.furnas.com.br/Ingles/index.aspx"
    title="Furnas Centrais El&eacute;tricas S.A." >Furnas Centrais
    El&eacute;tricas S.A.</a> an requested to State University of Rio
de Janeiro for the deployment of a simulator of the dynamics of
hydropower plant reservoirs. Designed to have commercial quality,
the software *FERSim* - as it was known - was intended to study
the dynamics of biomass incorporation during the step of filling of the reservoirs.

&nbsp;

GESAR group is part of the <a href="www.eng.uerj.br" title="Faculty of Engineering at UERJ">Faculty of Engineering</a> from
<a href="www.uerj.br">State University of Rio de Janeiro</a>, which is located at Campus Fonseca Telles, at the
heart of the park Quinta da Boa Vista, in the neighbourhood of
S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o, metropolitan region of Rio.
The pioneer investments at GESAR overpassed US&#36;1 mi, thereby
affording it to carry out the required limnological studies for
water bodies monitoring as well as three-dimensional computational
simulations of high complexity related to their dynamic motion.
GESAR's laboratories are specialized in both experimental
and computational threads that hold from external field survey
to chemical analyses at microscopic level. Currently,
the laboratories are being redesigned.

&nbsp;

Concerning the scientific collaboration, GESAR's partnerships
are spreaded worlwide with: [CWR - Center for
Water Research](http://www.cwr.uwa.edu.au/homepage.php)
(Austr&aacute;lia), [UNA - Universidad Nacional de
Asunci&oacute;n](http://www.una.py) (Paraguai) -, [TU Delft -
Universidade Tecnol&oacute;gica de Delft](http://www.tudelft.nl/en)
(Holanda), [LTCM/EPFL - Laboratoire de Transfert de Chaleur et de
Masse](http://ltcm.epfl.ch) (Su&iacute;&ccedil;a) e [ULB - Free
University of Brussels](http://www.ulb.ac.be//sciences/nlpc)
(B&eacute;lgica), among local institutions.

&nbsp;

Besides carrying on with studies in the fields of analytical chemistry
and data processing, GESAR is keen to theoretical and applied research
in biology, computational sciences and mechanics, although upholds
a traditional root in computer programming and finite element methods.
Such inherent features led GESAR to deploy a strong background in
the craft of the computational modelling of transport phenomena.
Through its projects, GESAR's portfolio comprises 26 projects
whose total amount of investments granted by the main Brazilian
fostering agencies (CAPES, CNPq, FINEP, FAPERJ) sum about US&#36;
3 mi.

&nbsp;

Being a Technological Development Unit, the GESAR group is able
to provide consulting as well as research services to public
and private companies. GESAR was also a cornerstone to start up the UERJ's
Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering (PPG-EM) activities in
2005. Initially, PPG-EM could offer academic masters courses only.
However, since the establishment of the doctoral program in 2010,
PPG-EM's numbers have been increasing toward forming new science personnel.
Hitherto (final of 2014), 15 masters and 3 doctor degrees has been conferred.
