# Short History of GESAR

&nbsp;

The GESAR group (Group for Studies and Environmental Simulations in
Water Reservoirs) was founded in 2005 after a R&#38;D project managed by
the brazilian power [Furnas Centrais El&eacute;tricas S.A.][1] an
requested to State University of Rio de Janeiro for the deployment of a
simulator of the dynamics of hydropower plant reservoirs. Designed to
have commercial quality, the software *FERSim* - as it was known - was
intended to study the dynamics of biomass incorporation during the step
of filling of the reservoirs.

&nbsp;

GESAR group is part of the [Faculty of Engineering][3] at the [State
University of Rio de Janeiro][2], which is located at Campus Fonseca
Telles, at the heart of the park Quinta da Boa Vista, in the
neighbourhood of S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o, metropolitan region
of Rio. The pioneer investments at GESAR overpassed US&#36;1 mi, thereby
affording it to carry out the required limnological studies for water
bodies monitoring as well as three-dimensional computational simulations
of high complexity related to their dynamic motion. GESAR's laboratories
are specialized in both experimental and computational threads that hold
from external field survey to chemical analyses at microscopic level.
Currently, the laboratories are being redesigned.

Concerning the scientific collaboration, GESAR's partnerships are
spreaded worlwide with: [CWR - Center for Water Research][11]
(Austr&aacute;lia), [UNA - Universidad Nacional de Asunci&oacute;n][12]
(Paraguai) -, [TU Delft - Universidade Tecnol&oacute;gica de Delft][13]
(Holanda), [LTCM/EPFL - Laboratoire de Transfert de Chaleur et de
Masse][14] (Su&iacute;&ccedil;a) e [ULB - Free University of
Brussels][15] (B&eacute;lgica), [Universit&eacute; du Havre][16]
(France), [University of Edinburgh][17] (UK, Scotland), [University of
Glasglow][18] (UK, Scotland) and [University of Strathclyde][19] (UK,
Scotland), among local institutions.

&nbsp;

Besides carrying on with studies in the fields of analytical chemistry
and data processing, GESAR is keen to theoretical and applied research
in biology, computational sciences and mechanics, although upholds a
traditional root in computer programming and finite element methods.
Such inherent features led GESAR to deploy a strong background in the
craft of the computational modelling of transport phenomena. Through its
projects, GESAR's portfolio comprises 26 projects whose total amount of
investments granted by the main Brazilian fostering agencies (CAPES,
CNPq, FINEP, FAPERJ) sum about US&#36; 3 mi.

&nbsp;

Being a Technological Development Unit, the GESAR group is able
to provide consulting as well as research services to public
and private companies. GESAR was also a cornerstone to start up the UERJ's
Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering (PPG-EM) activities in
2005. Initially, PPG-EM could offer academic masters courses only.
However, since the establishment of the doctoral program in 2010,
PPG-EM's numbers have been increasing toward forming new science personnel.
Hitherto (final of 2014), 15 masters and 3 doctor degrees has been conferred.

cultural and touristic attractions, such as:

&nbsp;

- [The Rio's Zoo][30];
- [The National Museum of Natural History (curated by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro][31];
- [The S&atilde;o Crist&oacute;v&atilde;o's Traditional Fair][32];
- [Quinta da Boa Vista Municipal Park][33];
