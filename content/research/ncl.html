Passive Cooling Systems are engineering solutions with the objective to
perform the function of transferring heat from a hot source to a cold
source without external energy, i.e., no support from active components.
Such systems have the advantage of (i) having simple composition in
comparison to active systems, which reduces costs, e of (ii) offering
operational reliability, which results in safety. Passive Cooling
Systems are employed, for example, in electronic components, engines and
energy generation. In particular, most of new nuclear power plant
designs is provided with at least one natural convection circuit for
safety function, and there are nuclear reactor designs whose normal
operation occurs by natural convection. However, Passive Cooling Systems
are subject to thermos-hydraulic instabilities, which requires a precise
physical characterization of the problem and fine adjustments of
numerical parameters in the modeling process.
