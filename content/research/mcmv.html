Started in 2009, the Brazilian Federal Government's Program "My Home, My
Life" (Programa Minha Casa Minha Vida - PMCMV, in Portuguese) aims
to provide housing for low-income people. To render the PMCMV's
management even more effective, the GESAR group has been deploying a
project which is intended to create a database system that able to
support deeds for the immersion of the PMCMV program at the
municipality of Queimados, in Rio de Janeiro state. Among the management
tools made available are included: social registration of families,
monitoring of works and infrastructure processes, and tracking of
chronograms and financial administration. Besides, such tool proposes to
expand older versions of the PMCMV's database in order to support
government's decision makings throughout the federative levels.
