Ballast water is used to ensure the stability and navigability of ships
during their voyages. Microorganisms that are found in ballast water can
be planktonik or benthonic, appearing as different lifeforms, such as
cists, eggs and larvae. During a unique cruise, a ship may, in general,
collect or cast out the ballast water at several seaport docks. In other
words, it means that they may carry billion cubic meters of ballast
water per year. Consequently, countless species of microorganisms are
transported from one place to another and thrown in non-native
ecosystems so giving rise to biological invasions. In turn,
environmental damages of global proportions may be caused. In that way,
the STAL - System for Ballast Water Treatment - project intends to
develop research focused on environmentally-friendly technologies that
handle microwaves to wipe out invasor organisms settled into ballast
water.
